-- Current Project Status --

Because FlowScale is built on top of openflow 1.0, we can't push rules specifying port ranges as this is a feature that is not supported by the openflow 1.0.
Right now the flow_handler.py daemon script is able to build a flows cache based on the gridftp traffic it sees from the Bro IDS.

Pushing rules through FlowScale will give us a way of managing the rules through a web interface.
